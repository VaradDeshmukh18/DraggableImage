# DraggableImage

A simple app for dragging image animation.
Using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose

This is a simple app showing draggable pizza card.
We can add more cards or functionalities to it.

We can limit the dragging further by adding constraints in X and Y co-ordinates.
But for the sake of simplicity, we have kept as it is.
